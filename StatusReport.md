# Update on each of the tasks including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc).


# An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed.
**Step 1: Project Setup and Data Acquisition - COMPLETED 4/2**
- Together:
  - Individual or Teams of 2 students with clearly defined roles and responsibilities
  - Collaboratively work using GitHub (create new group repo!)
  - Project report plan and all documentation completed using Markdown (add structure!)
  - Acquire different datasets from at least two distinct sources
  - Define one or more research questions (RQs) addressed by data collection and analysis
    
**Step 2: Data Integration & Preprocessing - IN PROGRESS; WILL COMPLETE BY 4/25**
- Shawna
  - Automatic (programmatic) integration of datasets using Python/Pandas and/or SQL (cf. Weeks 5-6)
  - Conduct data quality assessment and cleaning
- Angela
  - Document data profiling, quality assessment, and cleaning (cf. Week 7).
  - Document integration steps and any schema transformations.

**Step 3 (status report due 4/15): Analysis & Visualization - WILL COMPLETE BY 4/27**
- Shawna
  - Implement simple data analysis and/or visualization (answering at least part of your RQs)
- Angela
  - Document key insights and results in easy-to-understand language for key audience (US grocery shoppers who shop at/are interested in shopping at Costco)

**Step 4 (status report due 4/15): Workflow Automation & Reproducibility - WILL COMPLETE BY 4/30**
- Shawna:
  - Automated end-to-end workflow execution (cf. Weeks 9-10) to create a reproducible package (cf. Week 8)
  - Develop an automated end-to-end workflow
- Angela:
  - Ensure documentation is clear for reproducibility and future use, creating a reproducible package (cf. Week 8)
 
**Step 5 due 5/1: Finalization & Archiving - WILL COMPLETE BY 5/1**
- Both:
  - Accurate citation of data and software used (cf. Weeks 11-12)
  - Create metadata describing your package (cf. Week 12)
  - Archive your project in a repository, obtaining a persistent identifier (cf. Week 13)

# A description of any changes to your project plan based on your progress so far
We haven't made any major changes to our project itself, but we have slightly shifted our roles. Originally, Shawna was to focus solely on the technical and coding related aspects of this project, and Angela was to work on documentation. However, after discussing our project, we decided a more realistic approach that would leverage both of our strengths and skills would be to discuss the work to be done together and do the work together, that way we each will work on both the technical and documentational aspects of this project. Shawna will utilize her more technical background and skills, while Angela will use hers in writing, documentation, and communication. We also decided to use python and pandas more when possible as both of us are more familiar with python than SQL. We will also use past labs and assignments as resources to help us complete our project and make changes if needed.
