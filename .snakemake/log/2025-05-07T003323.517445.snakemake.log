MissingOutputException in rule clean_db in file "/Users/shawnaye/Desktop/is477/is477-sp25-group2/Snakefile", line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
countries_costs_cleaned.db (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Removing output files of failed job clean_db since they might be corrupted:
wb_indicators_cleaned.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
