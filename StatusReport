# Overview
The goal of this project is to collaboratively collect, integrate, analyze, and report on datasets while ensuring computational reproducibility. 

## Research Question(s)
How do Costco grocery prices correlate with social metrics of wellness in the United States?

## Team
**Shawna: Code master**  
- Shawna will work more directly with the code, such as assessing, cleaning, and transforming the code for quality analysis. This will allow us to gather meaningful insights from our code.  

**Angela: Documentation master**  
- Angela will work more on documenting the work done with the code and key analysis insights. This will allow our audience to better understand our process and results.


## Datasets
One of the two datasets we will be using for the project is a grocery store dataset that includes data from Costcoâ€™s online marketplace on prices, discounts, ratings, and other features about store items from 1 year ago in 2024. The other dataset we will be using is a world bank indicators dataset that include eceonmic metrics of GDP growth, social metrics such as school enrollment and poverty rate, environmental metrics such as renewable energy consumption, and demographic metrics such as urban population and life expectancy. This dataset is updated 2 years ago in 2023. Both of these datasets are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license that allows us to share, adapt, and build upon the data with appropriate credits.

## Timeline
**Step 1 due 4/2: Project Setuup and Data Acquisition**
- Together:
  - Individual or Teams of 2 students with clearly defined roles and responsibilities
  - Collaboratively work using GitHub (create new group repo!)
  - Project report plan and all documentation completed using Markdown (add structure!)
  - Acquire different datasets from at least two distinct sources
  - Define one or more research questions (RQs) addressed by data collection and analysis
    
**Step 2 (status report due 4/15): Data Integration & Preprocessing**
- Shawna
  - Automatic (programmatic) integration of datasets using Python/Pandas and/or SQL (cf. Weeks 5-6)
  - Conduct data quality assessment and cleaning
- Angela
  - Document data profiling, quality assessment, and cleaning (cf. Week 7).
  - Document integration steps and any schema transformations.

**Step 3 (status report due 4/15): Analysis & Visualization**
- Shawna
  - Implement simple data analysis and/or visualization (answering at least part of your RQs)
- Angela
  - Document key insights and results in easy-to-understand language for key audience (US grocery shoppers who shop at/are interested in shopping at Costco)

**Step 4 (status report due 4/15): Workflow Automation & Reproducibility**
- Shawna:
  - Automated end-to-end workflow execution (cf. Weeks 9-10) to create a reproducible package (cf. Week 8)
  - Develop an automated end-to-end workflow
- Angela:
  - Ensure documentation is clear for reproducibility and future use, creating a reproducible package (cf. Week 8)
 
**Step 5 due 5/1: Finalization & Archiving**
- Both:
  - Accurate citation of data and software used (cf. Weeks 11-12)
  - Create metadata describing your package (cf. Week 12)
  - Archive your project in a repository, obtaining a persistent identifier (cf. Week 13)
